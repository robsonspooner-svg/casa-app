### Description

Casa is an AI-powered property management app built for Australian property owners. It handles the work of a traditional property manager — rent collection, maintenance coordination, tenant communications, inspections, and compliance — at a fraction of the cost.

Traditional property managers charge 7-10% of your rental income. That's $2,500 to $4,000 per year on a typical property. Casa starts at $49 per month.

**What Casa does for you:**

- Collects rent automatically and tracks every payment
- Coordinates maintenance from request to completion
- Communicates with your tenants 24/7 via AI
- Manages lease generation, renewals, and e-signing
- Schedules and processes property inspections
- Handles bond lodgement with state authorities
- Runs tenant background and credit checks
- Generates financial reports for tax time
- Stays current with state-specific tenancy law

**How it works:**

Add your property. Casa's AI learns your preferences — your auto-approval limits, your preferred tradespeople, your communication style. From there, it manages the day-to-day. When a tenant reports a leaking tap, Casa triages the issue, finds a qualified tradesperson, gets quotes, and books the job. You approve with a tap, or set it to handle jobs under your threshold automatically.

Rent is collected via auto-debit. If a payment is late, Casa follows up with the appropriate notices, escalating only when needed. You get a clear view of income, expenses, and upcoming tasks in one place.

**Three plans to match how you manage:**

Starter ($49/mo) — You have a tenant and need help managing. Rent tracking, maintenance requests, AI communications, and condition report comparison.

Pro ($89/mo) — Full self-management with AI. Everything in Starter plus tenant finding, lease management, bond handling, professional inspections, full automation, and financial reports.

Hands Off ($149/mo) — For investors who want zero effort. Everything in Pro plus open homes, entry and exit condition reports, priority support, and a dedicated account manager.

No lock-in contracts. Cancel anytime. Your data is always yours.

**Built for Australia:**

Casa understands the differences between NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, and NT tenancy legislation. Lease templates, notice periods, bond rules, and inspection requirements are state-specific and kept current.

Your tenants use the free Casa Tenant app to pay rent, request maintenance, and access their documents. You never need to coordinate app downloads or subscriptions — it just works.

Property management without the property manager.
